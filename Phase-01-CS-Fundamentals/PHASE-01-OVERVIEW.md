# Phase 1: Computer Science Fundamentals

## Overview

This is the **most important phase** of the entire course. Everything in DevOps - containers, cloud servers, networking, automation - runs on computers. If you don't understand how computers work, you'll be copying commands without understanding why things fail.

## Topics in This Phase

| # | Topic | Duration |
|---|-------|----------|
| 01 | How Computers Work | 2-3 hours |
| 02 | Binary and Data Representation | 3-4 hours |
| 03 | Memory and Storage | 2-3 hours |
| 04 | Operating Systems Basics | 3-4 hours |

## Why This Matters for DevOps

Real interview question: *"Your container is running slow. What could be the problem?"*

Without CS fundamentals, you'd guess: "Maybe increase CPU?"

With CS fundamentals, you'd analyze:
- Is it CPU-bound (processing) or I/O-bound (disk/network)?
- Is it memory pressure causing swapping?
- Is cache being used effectively?
- Is there contention for resources?

**This is the difference between a junior and a senior engineer.**
